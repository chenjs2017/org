So the total cost of the project: 

Azure App Service 0.013/hour
Google Play Developer account will cost you $25 (one time),
Apple iTunes Developer account will cost you $99/year and 
Windows Developer account will cost you $19/year. 
SQL Server Database 0.021/hour
1. register diffrect accounts, setup developing environments: 1 days:
2. get push notification and schedule run on my own test phone: 5 days
3. publish to app store: apple's review procedure is very complicated, it might takes days, and they might just say the app is not good enough to add to app store
4. test push notification, 2 days.
